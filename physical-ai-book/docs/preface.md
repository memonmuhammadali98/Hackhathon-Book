# Preface

## Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the exciting world of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics! This textbook is designed to provide a comprehensive, hands-on introduction to the fundamental concepts, technologies, and practical applications that are shaping the future of robotics.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI, also known as Embodied AI, represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional AI systems that operate purely in digital environments, Physical AI systems interact with the real world through sensors and actuators. This embodiment enables robots to learn from physical experience, adapt to unpredictable environments, and perform tasks that require understanding of the physical world.

## Who This Book Is For

This textbook is designed for:

- **Students** pursuing degrees in robotics, computer science, or engineering
- **Researchers** exploring embodied intelligence and physical AI systems
- **Developers** building real-world robotic applications
- **Enthusiasts** passionate about robotics and wanting to gain practical skills

### Prerequisites

While we aim to make this content accessible, readers will benefit from:

- Basic programming knowledge (Python, C++)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with object-oriented programming concepts

## What You'll Learn

This textbook covers three main areas:

### 1. Foundational Concepts
- Physical AI and embodied intelligence principles
- Humanoid robotics fundamentals
- Sensory-motor learning and affordances
- Reactive vs. deliberative control systems

### 2. Practical Implementation
- ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) development
- Simulation environments (Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac)
- Robot control and manipulation
- Real-world deployment strategies

### 3. Advanced Topics
- Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- Navigation2 stack for autonomous navigation
- Perception and computer vision
- Human-robot interaction

## How to Use This Book
