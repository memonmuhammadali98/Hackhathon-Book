## Prompt

Generate the content for Chapter 6: Unity Simulation for High-Fidelity Robotics for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook".

Chapter 6: Unity Simulation for High-Fidelity Robotics
- Setting up Unity for robotics development.
- Creating humanoid articulation bodies and joints.
- Integrating Unity with ROS 2 (ROS-Unity bridge).
- High-fidelity sensor simulation (cameras, LiDAR).
- C# scripts for controlling humanoid robots in Unity.

All content should be in Markdown format, compatible with Docusaurus 3, and include text-based diagrams and C# code blocks where appropriate. Save this as `chapter6.md` in the `physical-ai-book/docs/chapters/` directory. The chapter should also include Q&A RAG micro-sections, as per the plan.md.

## Response snapshot
