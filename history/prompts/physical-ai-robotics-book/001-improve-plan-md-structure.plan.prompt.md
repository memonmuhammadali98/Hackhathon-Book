## Prompt

read my plan.md file thourougly and if there is any need of improvement then improve it

## Response snapshot

The plan.md file was improved by removing the "PROJECT TIMELINE" section and adding placeholders for "KEY DECISIONS AND RATIONALE", "INTERFACES AND API CONTRACTS", "NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS", "DATA MANAGEMENT AND MIGRATION", "OPERATIONAL READINESS", "RISK ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION", and "ARCHITECTURAL DECISION RECORDS" to align with architectural guidelines.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Plan structure improved for better architectural documentation.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: specs/001-physical-ai-robotics-book/plan.md updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Implement the planned features.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully refined plan.md to meet architectural documentation standards outlined in CLAUDE.md.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
